# ROBO-7000: Transformers for Robotics

Repository for **ROBO 7000 – Transformers for Robotics** (Fall 2025) at CU Boulder.

---

## Course Overview

This course explores transformer-based models and their applications in robotics, including:

- Language models (e.g., GPT)
- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
- Generative AI for robot trajectory planning
- Reinforcement learning and behavior cloning

**Course Goals:**

1. Understand transformer-based models for robotics and their limitations.
2. Summarize and present current research.
3. Advance state-of-the-art via independent projects.
4. Improve writing and research organization skills.
